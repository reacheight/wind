wind (= win dota xd) is a web application that tries to help you get good at Dota 2 by analyzing your matches and finding mistakes in your plays. No AI used.

Currently shut down and not in development.

## Dota stuff used in development
* [clarity](https://github.com/skadistats/clarity) for replay parsing
* [STRATZ](https://stratz.com) API for getting player profile and match history, match details, items and abilities info and probably something else
* [OpenDota](https://github.com/odota) API for replay downloading

## Features (some are implemented only at backend, some might work bad)
* Finding unused items and abilities that could save the player or his teammates
* Finding overlapped stuns
* Detecting bad fights and unreasonable dives
* Deaths breakdown
* Checking if courier is outside the fountain at the start of the game
* Calculating mana lost due to not switching Power Treads attribute
* Calculating gold fed with summoned units
* Detecting mouse usages instead of keybindings for some actions
* Detecting not tanked lane creeps before T1 tower
